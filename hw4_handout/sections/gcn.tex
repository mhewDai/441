\section{Implementing a GCN (\qgcnpoints points)}
\label{sec:gcnimpl}
We will now implement a 2-layer GCN based on the equation outlined in \Secref{sec:gcn}. Please note again that the solution should not use any library except Pytorch/Python.

We will implement a GCN in two steps, outlined below.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement one layer of GCN by finishing the implementation of \code{GCNLayer} at \pth{modeling/core/layers.py}. After you are done with your implementation, run the unit test at \pth{tests/gcn\_layer.py} to verify your solution on the small karate network. You can run the test with the command: 
    \begin{verbatim}
    python -m unittest tests/test_gcn_layer.py
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \item Finish the implementation of \code{GCN} at \pth{modeling/core/gcn.py} by plugging in the \code{GCNLayer} implemented above. Please check your implementation by running the unit test:
   \begin{verbatim}
    python -m unittest tests/test_gcn_model.py
    \end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}
