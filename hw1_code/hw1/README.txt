----- Prerequistes -----

The requirements.txt is in this src folder and you will need to input the command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The code was run in an enviroment for Python 3.6.7

----- About ------
This project implements text classification models using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) for sentiment analysis on the Amazon review dataset.

------ How to Run -------
You will need to use the command "python main.py" in terminal with the current files. Another way to run it is if you go to the main.py file and press command + b for Mac. 

----- Output -------

The output will show a series of training configurations for LSTM/CNN with/without pretrained Embeddings. At the end it will report a summary of the results and output two graphs with the CNN and LSTM results over 10 epochs. You can just click out of them.
