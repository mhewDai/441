\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Q1.] What is the big-O time complexity of the computation expressed in Equarion 1 in terms of $|\mV|$, $|\mE|$, $d$, $k$, and $L$? Your expression should not contain any other term. Assume $d < k$.

\begin{soln}
    
\end{soln}
    \item [Q2.] What is the space complexity of the computation expressed in Equation 1 in terms of $|\mV|$, $|\mE|$, $d$, $k$, and $L$ (assume intermediate terms are saved)? Your expression should not contain any other term.
